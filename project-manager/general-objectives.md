# General Project Objectives

This document outlines the overarching goals and vision for the Pokémon generation and collection application.

## Core Experience
- **Interactive Pokémon Generation:** Provide users with a fun and interactive experience for generating unique Pokémon creatures.
- **Personalized Collection Management:** Enable users to build, manage, and view their personalized collection of generated Pokémon locally.
- **Sustainable Gameplay Loop:** Implement a token-based economy where users can generate new Pokémon (costing tokens) and resell existing ones (refunding tokens) to extend their gameplay.

## Functional Goals
- **API Integration:** Successfully integrate with the external Pokémon generation API to create new creatures based on user prompts.
- **Local Data Persistence:** Ensure all user data, including token balance, collected Pokémon, and generation history, is stored securely and persistently using IndexedDB in the browser.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Develop a clean, aesthetic, responsive, and easy-to-use interface that guides users through the generation, collection, and resale processes.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for API interactions and user actions, providing clear feedback and guidance to the user.

## Technical Goals
- **Performance:** Optimize the application for smooth performance, especially during image generation and display.
- **Accessibility:** Design and develop with accessibility best practices in mind to ensure a broad user base can interact with the application.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, readable, and well-organized code following established coding guidelines and conventions (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Lucide React).
- **Security:** Ensure secure communication with the backend API, particularly regarding authentication.
